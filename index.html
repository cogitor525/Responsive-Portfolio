                    Hi, I'm Marcus. Currently I am learning web development in a bootcamp through UT Austin.
                    My brother Jeff and I started using computers back during the MS-DOS days;
                    our first was an AT/286 with an HDD of 20MB total capacity (lol).
                    Those early experiences helped in getting familiar with the Mac Terminal.
                    Now that we are well into HTML/CSS, things have gotten quite challenging!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm a pretty new resident to Austin, having moved here just over a year ago.
                    So far I am finding it quite enjoyable, although traffic does sometimes get kind of crazy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My interests include reading, film/TV, gaming, and hanging out with my two cats Akrout & Jouni.
                    (And of course, they would be the two pictured above :)
